Mission:
I decided to cross my interest in simulating full 3-dimensional Kerbal Space
Program rocket flights and it was a good excuse to try out the Scala I've been
learning.

Phases:
[ ] Phase 1: Get simulation of a single-stage rocket around Kerbin.
[ ] Phase 2: Get simulation of a multi-stage rocekt around Kerbin.
[ ] Phase 3: Add flight programs (burns at a given time/position trigger, for a duration and direction)
[ ] Phase 4: Add change of reference frame when transitioning between SOIs.
[ ] Phase 5: Add CLI for input and output.

See https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/844861 for task tracking.

Where are the tests?:
I'm normally so good with testing--even on personal projects--but this time
around I've got limited time to try out my idea and have so far been focusing on
architecting the code.  When my simulation is giving me useful results for KSP,
I may come back and add some cursory tests, but I have no plan to give proper
and thorough unit tests like I usually do.
